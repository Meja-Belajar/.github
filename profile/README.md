# Meja Belajar

This GitHub organization consists of repositories that serve as a university project codebase as part of the Software Engineering [[COMP6100001]](https://curriculum.binus.ac.id/course/COMP6100/) course. The project's objective is to equip students with the essential knowledge and skills required for success in software development, covering various aspects such as the software development lifecycle, process models, project management, architecture, and quality assurance. Each contributor in this repository plays a vital role in the Software Engineering project, with every group member contributing based on their assigned roles and responsibilities.

## Idea 
`Meja Belajar` is a web application designed to facilitate university students in becoming mentors or mentees. Mentors are students with excellent academic performance who assist other students in enhancing their academic excellence and mentees are students who are taught by mentors. This application will offer features to connect mentors with mentees, fostering a supportive learning environment within the university community.

## Features 
- **Mentor Search**: Enables mentees to find mentors based on their specific needs and academic subjects.
- **Mentor-Mentee Connection**: Connects mentors with mentees for academic support.
- **Academic Improvement**: Provides tools and resources to help students improve their academic performance.
- **Profile Management**: Allows users to create and manage their profiles, showcasing their skills, interests, and availability.
- **Scheduling**: Facilitates scheduling sessions between mentors and mentees.
- **Notifications**: Sends notifications for bookings and registration.
